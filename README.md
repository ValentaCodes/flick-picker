## About üìù

Have you ever found yourself spending more tiime researching a movie than you would have spent watching the movie itself?

If this applies to you (and even if it doesnt) then look no further!

Flick picker is an easy-to-use webpage that allows users to quickly find ratings from: Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and Internet Movie Database for that film. Not satisfied with critic rating? No problem! When you search for a film you will also be presented with the trailer, a summary of the plot, as well as the ratings. So you can spend more time popping popcorn, than researching a flick!
