## About

Flick picker is a simple to use webpage that allows users to quickly find ratings for a flick from Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and Internet Movie Database for that film. Not satisfied with critic rating? No problem! When you search for a film you will also be presented with the trailer. So you can quickly make a decision on watching the flick or not!
